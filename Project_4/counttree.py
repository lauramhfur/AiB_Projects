# The number T(n,k) of unrooted trees with n leaves and k internal nodes
# of arbitrary degree is given by the recursion:
#
# T(n,k) = k*T(n-1,k) + (n+k-3)*T(n-1,k-1)
#
# Either a new leaf is added attached to one of the k internal nodes of a
# tree with k internal nodes and n-1 leaves (the term k*T(n-1,k)), or a new
# node of degree is three (with the new leaf attached) is "placed" on one of
# the (n-1)+(k-1)-1=n+k-3 edges of a tree with k-1 internal nodes and n-1
# leaves (the term (n+k-3)*T(n-1,k-1))
#
# where
#
# T(n,1) = 1 and T(n,k) = 0 if k > n-2
#
# The total number of tree with n leaves is
#
# T(n,1) + T(n,2) + ... + T(n,n-2)
#
# and the total number of binary trees is
#
# T(n,n-2)
