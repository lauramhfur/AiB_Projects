    "You should make a program that implements the NJ algorithm as shown in the slides about tree reconstruction. Your program program should take a distance matrix in phylip-format as input and produce a tree in newick-format as output. You should know these formats from project 4. Your aim is to make your implementation as efficient as possible.\n",

    "1. Measure the time it takes to construct the corresponding NJ tree using QuickTree, RapidNJ, and your program.\n",

However, converting the big alignments to distance matrices would probably take too long and require too much space.)"
